# WebDev-MidtermExam-2020
A very simple PHP website to insert user(Student and Teacher) for one class only.

This is my first try using PHP to develop a web app, It's very primitive and I would love it if people give me advice on what 
could be done to make it better.

It work by assigning 1 class with a database that store classes, students, teachers and grades.

Teacher's account will be able to add or remove students and assign grade's to each student

Student's account are only capable of viewing their grades
